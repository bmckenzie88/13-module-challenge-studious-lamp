# Module 13 E-commerce Back End


## Description

This repo is for the back end an an e-commerce site. It consists of a working Express.js API using Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. It uses environment variables to store sensitive data like a MySQL username, password, and database name.

All packages required to run the application are installed by using the following command:


```bash
npm i
```

Once all necessary packages are installed, the next step is to run mysql and source the schema.sql file. Then, run `npm run seed` to seed data to the database from the `index.js` file in the `seeds` folder.

Once the database has been created and seeded, the application is invoked using the following command:


```bash
npm run watch
```


You can view a walkthrough video demonstrating the functionality of the application [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgXRA-hVrGY).
